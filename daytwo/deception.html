        Deception
    </h1>
    <p>
        Little Red Riding Hood, however, had been running about picking flowers, and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.<br><br>

        She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to herself: 'Oh dear! how uneasy I feel today, and at other times I like being with grandmother so much.' She called out: 'Good morning,' but received no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains. There lay her grandmother with her hood pulled far over her face, and looking very strange.<br><br>

        'Oh! grandmother,' she said, 'what big ears you have!'<br><br>

        'The better to hear you with, my child,' was the reply.<br><br>

        'But, grandmother, what big eyes you have!' she said.<br><br>

        'The better to see you with, my dear.'<br><br>

        'But, grandmother, what large hands you have!'<br><br>

        'The better to hug you with.'<br><br>

        'Oh! but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!'<br><br>

        'The better to eat you with!'<br><br>
